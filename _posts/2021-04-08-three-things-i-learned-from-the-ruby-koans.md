title: Three things I learned from The Ruby Koans
---

Here are (at least) three things I learned from [The Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/):


1. Symbols, Messages, and a few other topics were completely unheard of topics to me prior to the exercise, it was interesting to get exposure.
2. There are so many better ways to search within objects for specific text or values.  Methods like .find_all and regular expressions were extremely useful in parsing information.
